# Open Source Hardware Logo with Dave Jones's idea

This project is a quick and dirty way of displaying the proof of concept with Dave Jones's solution to the Open Source Hardware logo.

For a background on his idea, please watch his video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wrSXCBdalc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wrSXCBdalc)

### Notes

The text is really really bold. I made the assumption that it may be hard to read when on a PCB or a when extremely small. So this was a way to combat that.

Also, I'm not a designer. This modification doesn't look great.

### TODO
* Add other logos like the outline logo and the lighter version
* Clean up the text size, get a better font
* Fix Firefox download issue
  * Only works on Chrome at the moment
